# ✨ Public-Private Key (RSA) ✨
## 📎 Subject: Network Cryptography
### 📖 Project Backstory
Along with [Affine Cipher](https://github.com/sinatraXX/Affine-Cipher) and [Vigenere Cipher](https://github.com/sinatraXX/Vigenere-Cipher), the lecturer also asked us to create a simple program for doing both encrypt and decrypt with RSA algorithm and made [documentations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJ0n9NELsnuXXV9H4clOYJj2oYttAbeD/view) on it.
### 📝 How to use
Basically you can use this program like any other simple python program. No inputs necessary. You can also change your desired plaintext/ciphertext inside the program. Make sure to have the modules needed in the same directory in order to make the cracking program works.
